      <h2>Dataset: Seattle building permits (1998 - 2019)</h2>

      <p>
        This dataset contains all building permits issued or in progress in the city of Seattle, starting with the year
        1998.
        The data is provided by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections (SDCI), and as someone who would
        love to build
        a house one day, I thought this would be an interesting dataset to explore.
      </p>

      <p>
        The data is available online at:
        <strong>
          <a
            href="https://data.seattle.gov/Permitting/Building-Permits/76t5-zqzr">https://data.seattle.gov/Permitting/Building-Permits/76t5-zqzr</a>

      <h2>Initial Analysis Questions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Are there areas of Seattle where construction permits cluster?</li>
        <li>What has the status of construction been since 2014, the year I moved to Seattle?</li>
        <li>What is happening with construction in my neighborhood of Ballard, specifically?</li>
        <li>As someone who hopes to build a house one day, how long can I expect the Seattle permit process to take?
        </li>
        <li>What is the average cost of a construction project? Has this changed over time?</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

      <h2>Discoveries &amp; Insights</h2>

      I restricted the permit data to residential rather than non-residential, as my questions center around residential
      permits.
      It should be noted that a fairly significant number of fields in this dataset are "Null" and have been excluded
      from this
      analysis, perhaps indicative of less than stellar record keeping on Seattle's part?

      <div class="entry">
        <img src="./emilyek_a2/seattle_residential_permit_map.png" />
        <p class="caption">
          To orient myself, I first looked at a map of the location of all residential permits in the dataset. The
          density seems
          relatively uniform throughout, with perhaps more clustering in the Ballard, Fremont, South Lake Union, and
          Capitol Hill
          neighborhoods.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="entry">
        <img src="./emilyek_a2/residential_permit_type.png" />
        <p class="caption">
          I next stratified the data by permit type, which is classified by roof, grading, demolition, or building. The
          majority of
          permits seem to be for demolition or building, with some grading throughout the city and comparatively few
          roof permits.
          Demolition seems especially frequent in my neighborhood of Ballard, something of which I was already aware!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="entry">
        <img src="./emilyek_a2/residential_heatmap_post_2014.png" />
        <p class="caption">
          I was curious whether stratifying the data by year of permit issuance would reveal any structure in the data.
          I chose 2014
          because it was the year I moved to Seattle, and here the data is restricted to just building permits to the
          exclusion of
          roof, grading, or demolition. No obvious pattern is discernible -- it seems residential construction has been
          relatively
          uniform over these years.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="entry">
        <img src="./emilyek_a2/ballard_residential_permit_map.png" />
        <p class="caption">
          I love living in Ballard, so I was curious how the data looks in my neighborhood specifically. Here the map
          has been
          restricted to my zip code, 98107, and the frequency of demolition in Ballard is again apparent -- developers
          commonly buy up
          older single family homes in the neighborhood, replacing them with four tall townhouses on the same lot.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="entry">
        <img src="./emilyek_a2/ballard_residential_permit_map_post_2014.png" />
        <p class="caption">
          Limiting the data to 2014 and onward shows a similar trend for Ballard, possibly indicating that the majority
          of demolition
          in my neighborhood has been accomplished in these years. No grading has been done in 98107 since 2014, as this
          category
          disappears from the data and, consequently, the legend.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="entry">
        <img src="./emilyek_a2/application_duration_map.png" />
        <p class="caption">
          I next considered how long the construction process might take in Seattle, generating a metric for the period
          of time between the
          application date for the permit (defined as the date SDCI accepted the application as a complete submittal)
          and its completion
          date (defined as the date the permit had all its inspections completed). As can be seen from the map, this
          "application duration"
          measure is dominated by a few very long construction projects, making the colors of this figure not very
          informative. When
          specifying the application duration measure, I chose to restrict the data to building and demolition permits
          since these
          would be the type of construction projects I'd consider for building my own home.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="entry">
        <img src="./emilyek_a2/application_duration_histogram.png" />
        <p class="caption">
          Turning away from the map view, I generated a histogram of the application duration data. This figure suggests
          that most
          residential building and demolition permits take around a year to go from application to completion, but a few
          much
          longer-running construction projects are obscured by the histogram view. The Gantt chart at the bottom helps
          to identify
          these projects.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="entry">
        <img src="./emilyek_a2/application_duration_by_year.png" />
        <p class="caption">
          To look more closely at these long-running projects, I stratified the data by year. The spotty record keeping
          of the late
          1990s and early 2000s is apparent from the smaller amounts of data, and 2019 was excluded given that the data
          for the year is
          incomplete. I was curious whether the increasing availability of digital construction plans might streamline
          the permit process
          over time, and it does seem that application durations decrease as time goes on, with the exception of a few
          outliers.
          Note the impressive outlier from 2004 on the chart.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="entry">
        <img src="./emilyek_a2/housing_unit_histogram.png" />
        <p class="caption">
          The dataset also provides information on the number of housing units added or removed under a particular
          permit. Having watched
          the residential density of Ballard grow since moving to the neighborhood in 2014, I was curious whether this
          phenomenon
          applies more generally throughout Seattle. With the exception of a few very high density housing projects to
          the right tail
          of the histogram, and a few significant housing unit losses to the left tail, the majority of permits do seem
          to
          increase the overall residential density of the city, as measured by a net increase in housing units (defined
          as the number of
          housing units added minus the number of housing units removed).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="entry">
        <img src="./emilyek_a2/housing_unit_histogram_zoom_in.png" />
        <p class="caption">
          To look at this phenomenon in finer detail, I limited the view to the data-dense part of the histogram. Most
          residential
          construction projects had no net change in housing units, representing demolition and addition/alteration
          permit types.
          The next largest category reflects mostly new construction, with one unit added and zero units removed.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="entry">
        <img src="./emilyek_a2/residential_project_cost.png" />
        <p class="caption">
          Finally, I was curious about what I might expect the construction process to cost. I looked at the average of
          the estimated
          project cost, which comprises parts and labor and is based on fair market value, and compared its value over
          time (error bars
          represent 95% confidence interval). Perhaps not surprisingly, we can see the effects of the global financial
          crisis reflected
          in these data. I was initially surprised by the optimistic suggestion that residential construction costs
          ~100K, on
          average, in Seattle, before realizing that this comparatively low cost was being driven by the large number of
          additions/alterations in the dataset and not new construction.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="entry">
        <img src="./emilyek_a2/residential_project_cost_new_construction.png" />
        <p class="caption">
          Filtering the dataset on new construction only reveals a more pessimistic, but believable, view of
          construction costs, which
          unhappily for me (and unsurprisingly) appear to be increasing over time.
        </p>

      <div class="entry">
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          Seattle seems to be a city where residential construction costs and residential density are both increasing,
          reflecting what
          we already knew -- we live in a beautiful (and expensive) area, and we're not the only ones who want to live
          here. As for
          building my own home...at least I can expect the permit process to go relatively quickly!
